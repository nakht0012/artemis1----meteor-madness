#☄ Meteor Madness – NEO Impact & Earthquake Global Monitor

🌍 Introduction

Meteor Madness combines NASA and USGS open data to monitor and analyze global asteroid and earthquake risks in real time.
Built with Python, Streamlit, and Google Cloud, it visualizes potential impacts, calculates asteroid kinetic energy, and raises global awareness of both space and geological hazards.
